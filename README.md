# Hello World, I'm Marcus Crawford! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm an aspiring software developer currently diving deep into the world of coding with the Triple Ten Coding Bootcamp. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity and has grown into a full-blown passion for all things coding. From front-end design to back-end logic, I'm learning to navigate the vast sea of programming, one line of code at a time.

## 🎓 Triple Ten Coding Bootcamp
- **What's Cooking:** I'm currently tackling various projects ranging from simple HTML pages to complex JavaScript applications. Each challenge pushes me further, sharpening my skills and fueling my love for problem-solving.
- **Current Focus:** While the bootcamp covers a wide array of technologies, I find myself drawn towards Full Stack Development. Merging the beauty of front-end design with the logic of back-end operations fascinates me.
- **Future Aspirations:** By the end of this bootcamp, I aim to not only master the fundamentals but also to specialize in technologies that are shaping the future, such as React for UI development and Node.js for server-side programming.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- HTML5 & CSS3 for structuring and styling web pages.
- JavaScript for dynamic and interactive web applications.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open source projects focused on educational tools.
- Initiatives aimed at making coding more accessible to beginners.
- Any exciting project that can benefit from my growing skill set.
